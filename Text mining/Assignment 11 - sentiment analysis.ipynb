13 I am totally disappointed with this purchase of M13 I installed Miracast and also tried  few other casting app from play store but they are not working properly TV and phone gets disconnected often and I have to connect again and again  previously i was using Samsung J6 it had smart view so for casting I am still using my old J6Conclusion    If your are a person who use screen casting or Screen
